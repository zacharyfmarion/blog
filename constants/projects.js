      'Last fall I got into language parsing and decided to make my own language. I had played around with lexx and yacc before and found them prohibitively low-level for my taste. Then I found a great library called Babel-Bridge which uses parsing expression grammars to construct an interpreted language succinctly in ruby. Obviously this is not nearly as performant as something compiled in C, but it was incredibly fun to write. Amusingly, it ended up looking very similar to javscript, as that was the language I was using the most at the time.',
